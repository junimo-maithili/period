We were inspired by a speaker who came to our local library to talk about period poverty. We felt that we should step up and raise awareness about this issue, so we made Period Perfect.

With pages for chat forums and products, Period Perfect has lots of information for those who are just learning about their period.
Our "Products" page gives information about different period products. It also features a multiple-choise quiz about that uses your answers to determine what product is best for you.
Our home page features statistics on period poverty and helps others learn more.
